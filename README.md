### Routing in React using React-Router: Part1
Routing is one of the important concepts in terms of features while developing Single Page Application (SPA). Using routing we can load the view partially without loading the webpage again from the server which makes our web app very much faster in terms of performance. Routing is a kind of mechanism by which user can navigate through different URL’s available in a whole web application. But at the same time when we are developing large scale application than it is difficult to manage all the pages so for that, we can make use of routing to manage everything with ease.

### Routing in React using React-Router: Part2
In our previous article, we have developed simple routing mechanism where we can traverse through different URLs of the application, the same way if we have tons of pages into the application so in this case, the situation will be more complex to handle.For that, we can develop child routing or you can say nested routing in react application. To implement child or nested routing, in this article we will learn a simple approach for that.
